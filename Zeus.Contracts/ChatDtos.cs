// These DTOs mirror the relay wire protocol (cloud/zeuschat-relay/src/
// protocol.ts) on the Zeus side AND form the JSON envelopes Zeus pushes down
// to its own web clients inside the ChatEvent (0x35) binary frame. All field
// names serialise camelCase on the wire (JsonSerializerDefaults.Web).

/// a base64 data URL (<paramref name="DataUrl"/>, e.g. <c>data:image/jpeg;base64,…</c>
/// or <c>data:audio/webm;base64,…</c>) rather than via out-of-band blob storage.
/// The web client downscales/compresses photos and records voice at a low Opus
/// bitrate before sending so the encoded size stays within
/// <see cref="MaxDataUrlLength"/> — the relay persists the whole message in a
/// single Durable-Object value (128 KiB cap), so the attachment must comfortably
/// fit under that with room to spare. <paramref name="Kind"/> is "image" or
