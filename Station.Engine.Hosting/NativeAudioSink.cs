    // Why 90 ms and why adaptive (#742): the producer is the DSP RX tick, which
    // publishes audio in BURSTS gated to ~33 ms (MaybeTickInline) on the RX
    // packet thread — the same thread that also runs the squelch/leveler/plugin
    // chain and the panadapter/waterfall work. The consumer is the miniaudio
    // device callback draining steadily every device period. Between bursts the
    // consumer drains with no production, so the ring must hold at least one
    // inter-tick gap; any tick delayed by GC / CPU load / scheduler latency
    // drains further. The old 60 ms (2880) was only ~2 tick intervals — a single
    // delayed tick left too little margin and the callback short-read a silence
    // tail (heard as crackle): a G2 report showed ~4.6% of callbacks short-read
    // (222k silence samples) while the DSP side was provably healthy.
    //
    // 90 ms ≈ 2.7 tick intervals — absorbs a stalled tick with headroom while
    // avoiding a permanent 120 ms latency floor. The
    // EFFECTIVE target is also made adaptive at runtime to the negotiated device
    // period (see OnPlaybackData): miniaudio may ignore our 480-frame request and
    // hand us a larger callback, in which case the cushion grows to ≥ 4 callbacks
    // so a big-period default device can't outrun a thin fixed cushion. Pure
